# hello-world
This is my first repository "hello world"

Hello my dearest!
I'm Thiago Santos, my nickname is Saint because of a a famous japanese anime : Saint Seiya.
I love programming, analizing codes, discuss and create a new project.
"Got stuck in time" is not my lifestyle, I prefer hard working and "make up lost ground".
